### Art Piece 1

I chose “The Treachery of ImageNet” by Tom White. I came across the piece on nips4creativity.com, a website that features a collection of art, music, and design using machine learning as part of the NIPS Machine Learning for Creativity and Design Workshop. White created physical ink prints that loosely resemble various objects - an electric fan, sewing machine, ruler, and forklift. With the understanding that artificial intelligence systems use neural networks to recognize generalized inputs to be particular classifiers, White created images that trigger a specific ImageNet category. He accompanies the images with "This is not a..." referring to each of the ImageNet clasifiers. I think it's really interesting how these prints lightly resemble the classifiers, but I only noticed them when explicitly given the language of what the image is "not." While both humans and machines have a desire to neatly classify abstract things as something we know, the human brain and artificial intelligence systems are clearly distint in what stimuli they pick up on to classify things. I was drawn to it because it reminds of Rorschach tests, in which people classify ink blots are seemingly different things. It makes me wonder what sense I'd make of the various ink prints if not given what they are not.

### Art Piece 2

I chose the piece “42” by Channing Hansen because it combines the folksy craft of knitting (from independeny sourced and produced yarn) and advanced biological and computer science technology. Hansen's work was featured in Vice (linked below). He uses the SNP portion of his DNA that is the 1% that makes each person unique to generate an algorithm in Python. The algorithm instructs him when to change color, fiber blend, stitch, pattern, or make a mistake in his knitting. Additionally, he has created custom dyes using a NASA-based spectrometer. By using scientifically agreed upon wavelenghts of colors, he evades the subjectivity of our interpretations of colors, which he was well aware of siince he is partially colorblind. I think this combination is particularly interesting - the knitted painting represents his DNA and also responds to his genetic condition of colorblindness. The knitted piece based on the algorithm of his DNA but is abstract in that it does not represent DNA structures in anyway. Subsequently, there are so many hidden components to the piece that mark the uniqueness of Channing Hansen but are hidden within an abstract, colorful piece.
